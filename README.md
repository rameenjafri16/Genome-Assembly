# Genome-Assembly
This repository contains the workflow for assembling and analyzing a Salmonella enterica genome as part of a bioinformatics methods assignment. Raw Oxford Nanopore sequencing reads are assembled into a consensus genome, which is then compared to a reference genome obtained from NCBI using alignment

General overview
Long-read sequencing data generated using Oxford Nanopore Technologies were used to assemble the genome of Salmonella enterica using the Flye assembler. The resulting assembly was compared to a reference genome obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) through sequence alignment using minimap2. The goal of this analysis is to evaluate the feasibility, advantages, and limitations of long-read genome assembly and reference-based alignment for bacterial genomes.

Introduction
Long-read sequencing technologies became widely accessible with the introduction of the MinION by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) in 2014, enabling real-time sequencing of native DNA and RNA (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, 2025). Since then, additional long-read platforms have emerged, including Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and high-throughput systems such as QitanTech and CycloneSEQ (Zhang et al., 2023). These technologies vary substantially in accuracy, cost, and accessibility. PacBio HiFi sequencing can achieve base-level accuracies exceeding 99.99%, but requires expensive instrumentation and infrastructure, limiting its accessibility for smaller laboratories and field-based applications (Wang et al., 2021). Other long-read platforms can generate reads suitable for genome assembly but often exhibit lower base-level accuracy, with reported average read lengths of approximately 11.6 kb and quality scores around Q14.4 (Peng et al., 2025).

Oxford Nanopore sequencing offers several advantages that make it well suited for bacterial genome assembly. Unlike high-throughput short-read sequencing platforms such as Illumina or MGI, which typically produce reads of only a few hundred base pairs, nanopore sequencing generates long reads capable of spanning entire multidrug resistance (MDR) regions and complex genetic structures (Peng et al., 2025). This enables improved reconstruction of bacterial genomes and more precise identification of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) and mobile genetic elements, including plasmids, transposons, and integrons (Peng et al., 2025). In addition, ONT sequencing provides real-time data generation, portability, and relatively low cost. Compact devices such as the MinION support on-site sequencing in clinical, environmental, and resource-limited settings. Barcoding strategies further allow multiple bacterial genomes to be sequenced in parallel on a single flow cell, reducing per-genome sequencing costs and supporting rapid antimicrobial resistance surveillance during infectious disease outbreaks (Peng et al., 2025).

Despite these advantages, early ONT long-read sequencing was limited by relatively low raw read accuracy, approximately 90%, which was substantially lower than competing technologies. Continued improvements in nanopore chemistry and basecalling algorithms have significantly increased sequencing accuracy. A key advancement was the introduction of the R10 nanopore, which features a longer barrel and dual reader head capable of capturing two current perturbations as DNA passes through the pore, improving accuracy in homopolymeric regions. Subsequent developments, including the R10.4 and R10.4.1 flow cells and Q20+ chemistry, have enabled raw read accuracies exceeding 99%. Studies have shown that microbial genomes assembled using R10.4 data alone at sufficient coverage can achieve accuracy comparable to assemblies generated using earlier nanopore chemistries polished with Illumina short reads (Zhang et al., 2023). These improvements have reduced the need for hybrid assembly approaches and increased the feasibility of long-read-only genome assembly.

In addition to assembly challenges, aligning long, error-prone reads to a reference genome presents significant computational difficulties. Early alignment tools such as BLAST were designed for small numbers of high-quality long reads generated by Sanger sequencing, while later aligners were optimized for high-throughput short-read data produced by platforms such as Illumina. These tools are generally unsuitable for long-read sequencing due to higher error rates and substantially longer read lengths. As a result, specialized aligners were developed, initially motivated by PacBio data and later adapted for ONT reads. In 2016, GraphMap was introduced as the first aligner specifically designed for ONT data, using graph-based traversal methods to maintain alignment precision despite high error rates.

As ONT read lengths increased beyond 100 kb, minimap2 was developed using a seed–chain–align strategy optimized for long-read sequencing. Benchmarking studies have demonstrated that minimap2 runs substantially faster than other long-read aligners, including LAST, NGMLR, and GraphMap, without sacrificing alignment accuracy (Wang et al., 2021). While additional aligners such as GMAP, STAR, Graphmap2, and deSALT have been developed for splice-aware alignment of transcriptomic long-read data, minimap2 provides an efficient and accurate solution for reference-based alignment of genomic ONT reads. For these reasons, minimap2 was selected as the alignment tool for this study.

Overall, recent advances in ONT sequencing chemistry and long-read alignment algorithms have made long-read-only bacterial genome assembly increasingly viable. However, limitations remain, including sensitivity to parameter choices, potential residual base-level errors, and reliance on reference genome quality during alignment. This study applies these approaches to assemble and align the genome of Salmonella enterica to evaluate the strengths and limitations of long-read genome assembly and reference-based comparison.
