# Genome-Assembly
This repository contains the workflow for assembling and analyzing a Salmonella enterica genome as part of a bioinformatics methods assignment. Raw Oxford Nanopore sequencing reads are assembled into a consensus genome, which is then compared to a reference genome obtained from NCBI using alignment

General overview
Long-read sequencing data generated using Oxford Nanopore Technologies were used to assemble the genome of Salmonella enterica using the Flye assembler. The resulting assembly was compared to a reference genome obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) through sequence alignment using minimap2. The goal of this analysis is to evaluate the feasibility, advantages, and limitations of long-read genome assembly and reference-based alignment for bacterial genomes.
